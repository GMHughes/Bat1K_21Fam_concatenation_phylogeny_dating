The concatenated supermatrix phylogeny was generated using the following command:

Command: ./iqtree2 -s FcC_supermatrix.fas -spp NucPartitions.nex -nt 20 -bb 1000 -safe

where

=>FcC_supermatrix.fas is the supermatrix file containing the concatenated gene alignments, generated using FASconCAT-G_v1.06.1.pl

=>NucPartitions.nex is the partitioned best-fit models of sequence evolution.

using 20 threads and 1000 bootstraps
