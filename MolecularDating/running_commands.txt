Dating analyses was carried out using mcmctree, applied to all gene alignments assogned randomly to one of 73 bins

Within each bin, a concatednated supermatrix was then generated, serving as input for mcmctree, in addition to our species tree. Fossil callibrations were added to target nodes on the follwong file:
astral_fossil.tre

Each bin contained a directory 'divtime', containing the mcmctree software directories

Commands were applied to each bin as follows:

cd gH
../src/mcmctree mcmctree-outBV.ctl
../src/baseml tmp0001.ctl
cp rst2 out.BV
cd ../mcmc
cp ../gH out.BV in.BV
../src/mcmctree


Note that "astral.tre" is the general tree name used for both T1 and T2 tree topologies
